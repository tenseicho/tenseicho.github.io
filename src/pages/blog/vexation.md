All it took was a repressed lesbian to bring out a repressed transwoman. I do wonder what kind of horrors the woman who led me on for a decade is hiding?

Sorry sweetheart, you reap what you sow. I do know someone who is madly in love with you though. Although where I stand now, where the grass is in fact greener, I can only pity them.

My plan is finally coming into fruition at long last and I will not hide away any longer. The road to becoming a woman is going to be tough. There are going to be people who treat me like shit and make fun of me for all kinds of reasons, but here is why that doesn't concern me:

<div class="reasons">
  <div class="reason">
    <strong>Reason 1:</strong> I love the attention, I am an attention whore so if you just ignored me I would cease to exist but alas, here I am coming full-swing.
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="reason">
    <strong>Reason 2:</strong> When I look in the mirror and can see myself smiling, I have already won, if you are making fun of me you have lost. My question to you is simply this, why are you so sad & angry? Does it make you feel better to put others down, I'm sorry to hear that cupcake.
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="reason">
    <strong>Reason 3:</strong> If I am in a toxic bubble, that's all it is, just a bubble. I can easily leave that if I feel like I'm not enjoying myself despite the fact there will be people will want me dead in the ground six feet below them. Again, read reason 1.
  </div>

Hope y'all are enjoying the show so far.
