Why did Carolina burn so many bridges? 

Because he was emotionally immature.

I did consider writing a lot more messages but I like to keep things simple. If you want to be my friend, you are more then welcome to. I've written how wrong I have felt about the way I treated people in the past so many times and time is very short. I love and hate all of you for a variety of different reasons. 

Going forward, my name is not Carolina or Tensei, it's Vanessa. I'm going to be a transwoman. I will change my legal name at some point to it as well.

I know that sounds fucking insane if you knew anything about my previous iteration. However, this has always been me. I repressed a better part of myself for such a long time. Now that I am at the self-actualization stage. I can fully realize my dreams.

Or maybe you did know? A man named Carolina who said he was non-binary. Buying a transflag "ironically" for my room. Buying a Bl√•haj for my trip to Portland. The clues were there, but only for those with eyes to see.

Anyways, I will explain it all very soon. I just need a ton of time to wrap my head around how I want to explain my thoughts on everything. For now, I will leave you with this.

If you could love me as a man

You're going to fall head over heels for me as a **woman**
