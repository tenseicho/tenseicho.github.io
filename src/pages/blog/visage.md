Now that I have all my queens in check, it's only appropriate that I talk about my kings.

Funny to think GuyGamerZzZZ was just a reverse harem.

I'm going to take 3 specific people and talk about relationship dynamics. I won't say their names, but I'm sure you know who I am talking about when I write these. I have a lot of new fans (friends) so I don't want to dox anyone. In descending order:

**Three**: I would do anything for him. Which is inherently a problem because the same could not be said for me. I was his millennial puppygirl; I'm cringing saying that, but it was true. I loved you so much because I saw you as a positive male role model. I needed someone to latch onto without being honest about what kind of person I was. The scales were tipped too much in his direction, and it showed. That's why I didn't accept your friend request on multiple occasions. I needed to figure out why things got the way they did, and everything finally makes a lot more sense now. As long as you can forgive my past transgressions, maybe we can play some more Strive together again. Maybe ðŸ˜Š

**Two**: This was the opposite problem. They would lie on the ground and let me walk all over them. I didn't see our relationship that way, which is my fault. I should have been more honest about how I saw our relationship, and I'm sorry. We were both people-pleasers, and we were not good for each other. The path that we would end up leading ourselves down would be our own downfall. I really am sorry I couldn't communicate that with you at the time because I was a coward and I thought you were a spy for Pie (everyone is, idgaf anymore). I'm sure we can be friends again, but I want you to be better. You deserve it, king. ðŸ˜Š

**One**: This was the perfect balance. I was the Yin to his Yang. I feel like we both complemented each other in our own unique, albeit quirky, way. There was only one problem: I fell in love with you. I wasn't what you were interested in, and that, in the back of my head, broke me. In a way, you stole my very feminine heart, and I had to confront those feelings that I never had before. I will go into far more detail in my next blog post because it's not fair to give your ego any more of a boost than it already has. The most charming man with a heart of gold, what more can be surmised? By the way, congrats on reaching Immortal. Maybe one day we can duo queue together again, as friends ðŸ˜‰

Next post will be about yours truly.
