To whoever this concerns,

I have gleamed as much information as I can because I'm an obesseive loser about you. I use that in the most derogatory way possible because it's obvious you don't want anything to do with me which I can't say I blame you. Reason, the losers I hang around like to use that against me because I'm still emotionally devastated by what transpired three years ago. And the fact that another friend of ours subtly leaked it and is now enjoying it. I hope he finds love in his own heart at some point.

I'll leave you and your wife alone. I got my own problems to deal with anyway. I just sometimes get emotional because I have zero family or friends right now in my transition and I sometimes look back on our very short intimacy together as the one moment that made me the happiest in all of my life (so far).

I hope to find that someone to share that level of intimacy that we had together. As I am glad that you have found someone to share it with. 

Otherwise, I'll be a goth bitch till the day I die.
