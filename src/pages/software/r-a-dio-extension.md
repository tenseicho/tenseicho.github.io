# R/a/dio Extension

A browser extension for the R/a/dio online radio station that enhances the listening experience with additional features and functionality.

## Features

- Real-time song information display
- Desktop notifications for new tracks
- Quick access to station controls
- Song history tracking
- Customizable interface
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Technical Details

This extension is built using JavaScript and the Browser Extensions API, making it compatible with major browsers. It interfaces with the R/a/dio API to fetch real-time data about currently playing tracks, upcoming songs, and listener statistics.

The extension uses a modular architecture to separate concerns between the data fetching, UI rendering, and notification systems. This makes the codebase maintainable and extensible for future features.

## Development

The project is open source and available on GitHub. Contributions are welcome for new features, bug fixes, or improvements to the existing codebase.
