# Encryption Tools

A comprehensive suite of cryptographic tools built in Python, designed to provide secure data handling capabilities. This project aims to make common encryption tasks more accessible while maintaining high security standards.

## Features

- File encryption/decryption
- Password-based key derivation
- Secure random number generation
- Hash function implementations
- Digital signatures
- Key management utilities

## Technical Implementation

The project is built using Python's cryptography library, which provides cryptographic recipes and primitives. The implementation follows best practices for secure coding and includes:

- AES-256 encryption for file handling
- PBKDF2 for key derivation
- SHA-256 for hashing
- RSA for digital signatures
- Secure key storage mechanisms

## Current Status

The project is actively being developed with the following components completed:
- Core encryption/decryption functionality
- Basic key management
- File handling utilities

Upcoming features include:
- GUI interface
- Command-line tool
- Additional encryption algorithms
- Enhanced key management features
