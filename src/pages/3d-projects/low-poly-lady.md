# Low Poly Lady

A stylized low-poly female character model created with a minimalist aesthetic. This project explores the balance between simplicity and expressiveness in character design.

## Project Overview

The low-poly lady model features:
- Clean, minimalist geometric design
- Expressive pose and silhouette
- Carefully balanced proportions
- Optimized low-poly topology

## Technical Details

### Modeling
- Created in Blender using low-poly modeling techniques
- Strategic polygon placement to define key features
- Clean topology for smooth deformation
- Optimized for real-time applications

### Texturing
- Simple color palette with minimal texturing
- Flat shading to emphasize the geometric design
- Strategic color placement to enhance form

## Development Process

The project began with silhouette studies and basic blockouts to establish the character's pose and proportions. The modeling process focused on using as few polygons as possible while maintaining a recognizable and appealing character form.
