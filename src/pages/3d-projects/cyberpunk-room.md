# Cyberpunk Room

A detailed 3D environment showcasing a cyberpunk-themed room. This project combines architectural design with sci-fi elements to create an immersive futuristic space.

## Project Overview

The room features a mix of high-tech elements and lived-in details, including:
- Holographic displays
- Neon lighting
- Custom-designed furniture
- Detailed tech accessories
- Atmospheric lighting setup

## Technical Details

### Modeling
- Created in Blender using hard-surface modeling techniques
- Modular design approach for efficient asset reuse
- Custom geometry for unique architectural elements

### Texturing
- PBR materials created in Substance Painter
- Custom wear and tear effects
- Emissive materials for neon elements
- Multiple UV sets for complex materials

### Lighting
- Dynamic lighting setup with emission materials
- Volumetric effects for atmosphere
- Screen space reflections
- Global illumination for realistic light bounce

## Development Process

The project went through several iterations, starting with basic blockouts and progressing to detailed modeling and texturing. Special attention was paid to maintaining a balance between visual impact and performance optimization.
