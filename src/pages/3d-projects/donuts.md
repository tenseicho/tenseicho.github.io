# Donuts Collection

A mouth-watering collection of 3D modeled donuts featuring various glazes, toppings, and designs. This project explores food modeling techniques and material creation.

## Project Overview

The donut collection features:
- Multiple donut varieties with different toppings
- Realistic texturing and materials
- Careful attention to detail in sprinkles and glazes
- Appetizing presentation and composition

## Technical Details

### Modeling
- Created in Blender using subdivision surface modeling
- Procedural techniques for sprinkles and toppings
- Careful attention to realistic proportions and details
- Sculpting used for organic imperfections

### Texturing
- PBR materials for realistic glazes and dough
- Procedural noise for natural variation
- Subsurface scattering for realistic dough appearance
- Custom shader work for sugar and sprinkles

## Development Process

The project began with reference gathering of real donuts to understand their structure and appearance. Each donut was modeled individually with unique characteristics, while maintaining a consistent style across the collection. Special attention was paid to the material properties to achieve a realistic, appetizing appearance.
