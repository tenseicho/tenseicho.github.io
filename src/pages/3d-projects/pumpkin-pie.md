# Pumpkin Pie

A detailed 3D model of a traditional pumpkin pie, complete with a flaky crust and creamy filling. This project explores food modeling techniques and realistic material creation.

## Project Overview

The pumpkin pie model features:
- Realistic crust texture with detailed crimping
- Smooth pumpkin filling with subtle surface details
- Optional whipped cream topping
- Accurate proportions and scale
- Warm, appetizing presentation

## Technical Details

### Modeling
- Created in Blender using subdivision surface modeling
- Displacement maps for crust texture
- Sculpting techniques for organic details
- Careful attention to edge flow for realistic deformation

### Texturing
- PBR materials created in Substance Painter
- Custom procedural textures for the filling
- Subsurface scattering for realistic food appearance
- Micro-surface details for the flaky crust

## Development Process

The project began with reference gathering of real pumpkin pies to understand their structure and appearance. The modeling process focused on creating a realistic representation while maintaining good topology. Special attention was paid to the material properties to achieve the characteristic appearance of a freshly baked pie.
